# PAIB
PAIB is Pta's Amazing IRC Bot, although on #ludumdare it can also stand for Pta's Amazing Idea Bot (because that's what it's doing there ;))

# Installing
PAIB is an extensible IRC bot written in python3 using the IRC module. You can easily set it up:

    $ sudo pip3 install irc
    $ git clone https://github.com/pta2002/paib.git
    $ cd paib
    $ python3 paib.py

This should get you running

# Changing the config
As of now, PAIB only runs in a single channel. This is how config.json would look like for #paib on irc.afternet.org (port 6667):

      {
        "connection": {
          "server": "irc.afternet.org",
          "port": 6667,
          "nick": "paib",
          "channel": "#paib"
        },
      
        "botsettings": {
          "command_prefix": "$",
          "plugins_folder": "plugins",
          "ignored": ["bot1", "bot2"]
        },
      
        "admin": {
          "admins": ["example"]
        }
      }

The settings on the config file are meant for #ludumdare, where I (pta2002) am the paib admin and where yaib and lunabot are two other bots that we should ignore.
